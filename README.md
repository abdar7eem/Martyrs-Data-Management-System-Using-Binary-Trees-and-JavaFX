# Martyrs-Data-Management-System-Using-Binary-Trees-and-JavaFX
This Java project aims to create a complex data structure for storing and managing information about martyrs, using a combination of binary trees, stacks, queues, and linked lists. The primary goal is to allow users to efficiently store and retrieve martyrs' records, categorized by district, location, and date. The program is structured around a hierarchical data model, where districts are organized alphabetically within a binary tree, and each district contains a tree of locations, which in turn contains a tree of martyr dates. For each martyr date, a linked list stores the details (name, age, and gender) of martyrs, sorted by age and gender.

The project involves a graphical user interface (GUI) implemented using JavaFX, enabling users to load a CSV file containing martyr data, navigate the data structure, insert, update, or delete records, and search for specific martyr information. Key object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts applied in this project include encapsulation, where the various trees and linked lists are packaged into modular, self-contained components; inheritance, which might be used to define general structures like nodes or lists that can be extended; and polymorphism, especially in terms of how different classes (e.g., for districts, locations, and dates) interact and perform specific functions. Additionally, the use of stacks and queues for navigation demonstrates efficient data management and traversal, fundamental to the OOP paradigm in Java.
